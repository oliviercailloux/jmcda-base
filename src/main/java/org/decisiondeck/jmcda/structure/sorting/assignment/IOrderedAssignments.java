 * <p>
 * Equivalent to {@link IAssignments} to use when the categories the alternatives are assigned to are provided with a
 * total ordering, thus can be sorted from worst to best without ex-Ã¦quo.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <em>Contrary</em> to {@link IAssignments} however, this object mandates that when setting an assignment of an
 * alternative to some category, these categories be pre-defined. This can be done using the
 * {@link #setCategories(SortedSet)} method and is necessary for this object to know the ordering on the categories, to
 * know how to interpret the assignments in terms of ordered categories and ensure that the method
 * {@link #getCategories()} returns a superset of the used categories. This interface does not extend
 * {@link IAssignments} because of this restriction it has on the categories to which an alternative may be assigned,
 * which must be predefined. The other interface does not have such a requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An ordered assignments object equals an other one iff they contain the same alternatives assigned to the same
 * categories and contain the same set of overall categories in the same order. This definition is compatible with the
 * definition of equality over ordered assignments to multiple categories objects.
