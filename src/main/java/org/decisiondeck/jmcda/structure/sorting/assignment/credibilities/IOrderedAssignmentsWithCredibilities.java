/**
 * <p>
 * A set of assignments where one assignment is a mapping of an alternative to a set of ordered categories, with
 * associated credibilities, meaning that each category to which an alternative is mapped has an associated degree of
 * credibility (a real number greater than zero) indicating how strong the alternative belongs to that category. An
 * alternative is said to be assigned if it is assigned to at least one category (i.e. the set of categories to which it
 * is mapped may not be empty).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is an equivalent to {@link IAssignmentsWithCredibilities}, to use when the categories the alternatives
 * are assigned to are provided with a total ordering, thus can be sorted (the categories) from worst to best without
 * ex-Ã¦quo.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <em>Contrary</em> to {@link IAssignmentsWithCredibilities} however, this object mandates that when setting an
 * assignment of an alternative to some categories, these categories be pre-defined. This can be done using the
 * {@link #setCategories(SortedSet)} method and is necessary for this object to know the ordering on the categories, to
 * know how to interpret the assignments in terms of ordered categories. This interface does not extend
 * {@link IAssignmentsWithCredibilities} because of this very restriction it has on the categories to which an
 * alternative may be assigned, which must be predefined. The other interface does not have such a requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface does <em>not</em> extend {@link IOrderedAssignmentsToMultiple} because that would require it to guess
 * some credibilities when an alternative is simply affected to a set of categories. See
 * {@link IOrderedAssignmentsToMultiple} for more informations.
