 * Equivalent to {@link IAssignmentsToMultiple} to use when the categories the alternatives are assigned to are provided
 * with a total ordering, thus can be sorted from worst to best without ex-Ã¦quo.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <em>Contrary</em> to {@link IAssignmentsToMultiple} however, this object mandates that when setting an assignment of
 * an alternative to some categories, these categories be pre-defined. This can be done using the
 * {@link #setCategories(SortedSet)} method and is necessary for this object to know the ordering on the categories, to
 * know how to interpret the assignments in terms of ordered categories. This interface does not extend
 * {@link IAssignmentsToMultiple} because of this restriction it has on the categories to which an alternative may be
 * assigned, which must be predefined. The other interface does not have such a requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An ordered assignments to multiple categories object equals an other one iff they contain the same alternatives
 * assigned to the same categories and contain the same set of overall categories in the same order.
