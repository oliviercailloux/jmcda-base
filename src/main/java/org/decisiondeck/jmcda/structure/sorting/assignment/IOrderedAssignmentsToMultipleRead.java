/**
 * <p>
 * Equivalent to {@link IAssignmentsToMultipleRead} to use when the categories the alternatives are assigned to are
 * provided with a total ordering, thus can be sorted from worst to best without ex-Ã¦quo.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An assignments to multiple categories object equals an other one iff they contain the same alternatives assigned to
 * the same categories and the same set of overall categories. The last condition is not redundant as the set of
 * categories may be a superset of the set of categories to which alternatives are assigned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface does not extend {@link IOrderedAssignmentsWithCredibilitiesRead} because it would involve automatic
 * guess of arbitrary credibility degrees, e.g. one divided by the number of categories an alternative is assigned to.
 * This would then forbids an algorithm to clearly specify if it really uses credibility degrees as input or not. The
 * user could think that an algorithm will not use the credibility degrees whereas it will use them, therefore making
 * use of credibility numbers which have no real meaning.
